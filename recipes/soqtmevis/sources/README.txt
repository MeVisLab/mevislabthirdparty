This is version 1.1 of SoQtMeVis,
an OpenInventor scene viewer based on Qt4.2.

This is a port of the X/Motif viewer that comes with the LGPL
version of OpenInventor from SGI.

This port was done at MeVis Research, Bremen, Germany
(http://www.mevis.de) in 2006 by Uwe Siems 
(and Florian Link, Felix Ritter, Marcus Barann).

Any additional (art)work is also put under version 2.1 of the
GNU Lesser General Public License.

This library should be roughly source compatible with other SoQt
versions floating around, though some methods may have changed their
names and parameter types. If you find bugs, make improvements or
just have suggestions, send an email (preferrably with a patch) to
usiems@mevis.de or link@mevis.de .
