Changes for the MeVis version of SoQt:
======================================

Version 1.0:

- setDrawToFrontBufferEnable and friends was removed
(it is expected that current graphics systems are fast enough)

- cut&paste was removed
(did anyone use this?)

- handling of devices was changed
(mouse and key handling should not be done by "external" devices)

- the real GL widget is not created in the constructor
(this allows us to change properties first - probably should somehow
 be automatic anyway)
 
- cursor shapes and mapping of mouse buttons to scene functions (in
viewing mode) can be changed for the SoQtExaminerViewer

- ability to set pre- and post-scene callbacks in SoQtRenderArea

- many small changes - too many to mention them here
