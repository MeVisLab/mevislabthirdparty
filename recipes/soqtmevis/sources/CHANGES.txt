Version 1.0:

Initial release

Version 1.1:

- Removed QGLFormat::setDepthBufferSize() because it specifies the minimum
depth buffer size and not the preferred.
- Restrict the amount by which one can zoom in to the origin of the scene (it
can get hard to get out of extreme zoom levels again).
- Add ability to set color depth of the viewer (if Qt and OpenGL driver permit
it).
- Introduce new method renderToCurrentContext as a hack to conveniently render
to pre-existing contexts.
- One must now actively enable redrawRequested signals when the widget is not
visible.
- Additionally updateGL is only called in the renderCB if the widget is visible.
- Add option to always initialize GL context in renderToCurrentContext.
- Reduced minimum x/y sizes for the inner render window from 100/100 to 10/10.
- Added focus setting of the QGLWidget in a mouse button press.
- Put pick mode and view mode buttons in a mutually exclusive button group, so
one can't de-select both.
