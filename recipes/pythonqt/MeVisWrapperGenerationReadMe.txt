Only the PythonQt library is currently build. The wrapper generator has been build
and executed manually for Qt4/5 based versions, and has to be reworked for Qt6 based on shiboken.
This has to be done in the sources located in GitHub under https://github.com/MeVisLab/pythonqt.

The wrappers generated for the latest supported Qt5 version can be found under generated_cpp.
Ideally, the wrapper generation for Qt6 will be automated. 
If there will still manual steps be needed, this README will be the place to describe them.
