PythonQt
--------

PythonQt is a dynamic Python (http://www.python.org) binding for Qt (http://www.trolltech.com).
It offers an easy way to embed the Python scripting language into
your Qt applications. It makes heavy use of the QMetaObject system and thus requires Qt4.x.

Licensing of PythonQt
---------------------
PythonQt is distributed under the LGPL 2.1 license.

Licensing of Generator
----------------------
The build system of PythonQt makes use of a patched version of the LGPL'ed QtScript generator,
located in the "generator" directory.

See the LICENSE.LGPL file in the generator subdirectory for details.
Copyright (C) 2009 Nokia Corporation and/or its subsidiary(-ies)

See http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/qtscriptgenerator for the original project.
The PythonQt wrappers generated by the generator are distributed under the LGPL as well.


The generated wrappers are pre-generated and checked-in for Qt 4.4.3, so you only need to build and run the
generator when you want to build additional wrappers or you want to upgrade/downgrade to an newer Qt version.
