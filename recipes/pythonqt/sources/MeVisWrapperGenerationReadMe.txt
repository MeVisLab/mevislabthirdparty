Download/Building the Generator
--------------------------------

The PythonQt wrappers are generated by a generator which is located on SourceForge.

To build the generator, checkout:

https://svn.code.sf.net/p/pythonqt/code/trunk/

and build the pythonqt_generator located in the generator directory.

Example for Windows:
> call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
> set QMAKESPEC=win32-msvc2012
> set QTDIR=c:\repository\dev\MeVis\ThirdParty\Sources\Qt4\qt
> set PATH=c:\repository\dev\MeVis\ThirdParty\Sources\Qt4\qt\bin;%PATH%
> qmake -tp vc -r PythonQt.pro

Running the Generator
---------------------

Once the generator has been created you can run it like this:

> set QTDIR=YOURQTDIR
> set PATH=%QTDIR%/bin;%PATH%
// for VC12 it was needed to clear the INCLUDE env variable:
> set INCLUDE=

> release/pythonqt_generator.exe

This should generate the wrappers in generated_cpp, above the generator directory.
 
Copying the resulting files
---------------------------

The generated files need to be copied to the correct places in our directory:

generated_cpp/com_trolltech_qt_[core|gui]_builtin -> MeVis/Foundation/Sources/PythonQt/generated_cpp

generated_cpp/com_trolltech_qt_[core|gui|network|opengl|webkit|xml|xmlpattern] -> MeVisLab/Standard/Sources/Bindings/generated_cpp

Note on automation
------------------
Currently the generation process is started manually. It could make sense to include the generator in our repository and add
automated build scripts to automate the wrapper generation. The xmlpattern wrappers do not compile when generated and still need manual
patching. It would make sense to get the wrappers working but there was no time to do that yet.
When automating the wrapper generation, I suggest that this is still not started on a nightly basis and not on all platforms,
since the wrapper updates are seldom (on each Qt upgrade or if issues arise) and wrappers generation might differ between platforms.
Up to now the wrappers have been generated by Florian Link when requested.
