This directory contains the perl script for the 'longToInt32' utility, used
to convert a list of files from using "long" types to "int32_t" types.

---
   longToInt32  changes longs to int32_ts and all the changes
   associated with this (see the s/from/to/ lines for all the
   gory details).

   Note:  This perl script will not change any longs on a line with
    either of the strings "system long" or "System long".  
    Therefore, if you have a long that must remain in the code, 
    then insert a comment on the same line as the long and 
    include one of the above strings.  The comment may appear
    anywhere on the line.

   Suggestions for use:
   --------------------
      Work in manageable chunks by identifing a directory whose
      contents (and subdirectory contents) will not overwhelm you.

	  cd to that directory, and run the following command to
          get a list of filenames.  Each file will contain the
	  string "long" (case insensitive) in it:

	  find . -print | xargs grep -l -i long > /tmp/long.files

      In one window, edit /tmp/long.files  and in another run

	  longToInt32 /tmp/long.files -m | more

      and consider whether you want the script to edit the file for  
      you, the file should be removed from the list, or whether you
      want to add the special string "system long" to one or more 
      lines of the file.  Execute the script with no arguments to
      get a list of options.

       run: longToInt32               to see the options

      (the -m option enables printing of modification information to 
      stdout).  

      When you are ready to replace the files with their int32 counterparts,

        longToInt32 /tmp/long.files -r    (plus your choice of options)

      The -r enables REPLACEMENT of the original file.  The original files
      will be retained with the extension  ".old".
