ivperf reads in an Inventor scene graph and analyzes its rendering
performance.  If you know that caches at certain separators will be
invalidated because your application changes data under them, name
these separators "NoCache" (i.e. DEF NoCache ...).  ivperf will
then correctly simulate the autocaching behavior on the scene graph.

Running ivperf without any arguments will list the usage message.

ivperf's output can be graphically displayed in the form of a bar
chart.  The first bar (red) is the total time taken to render a
frame, and the other bars (yellow) are the approximate times spent
in each rendering stage.  They are (in order):

	- Clearing the graphics window
	- Traversing the Inventor scene graph
	- Changing material state
	- Changing the GL transformation matrix
	- Texture mapping
	- Texture management
	- Lighting
	- Transforming verties in the pipeline
	- Filling polygons
	
See the "Open Inventor 2.1 Porting and Performance Tips" for more
information on using ivperf.
