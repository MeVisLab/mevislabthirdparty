This directory contains source code for the 'ivcat' utility, used
to convert from binary to ASCII Inventor format.

It works like the standard unix 'cat' utility, reading the named files
(standard input if no files are specified or a filename of '-' is
given) and writing a Inventor file to standard output.

If the argument '-b' a binary file is written; otherwise, an ASCII
file is written.

Examples:

To convert from ASCII Inventor to binary:

ivcat -b asciifile.iv > binaryfile.iv

To convert from binary Inventor to ASCII:

ivcat binaryfile.iv > asciifile.iv
