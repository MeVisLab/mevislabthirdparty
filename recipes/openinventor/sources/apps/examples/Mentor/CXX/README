Type `make <ch#.ex#.name>', to make an individual C++ example,
where   ch# is the chapter number from the Programming Guide,
	ex# is the example number from the Programming Guide,
	name is the short name describing the example.

e.g. `make 02.3.Trackball'
      makes the chapter 2, example 3, trackball example (see The Inventor Mentor)

To create all of the C++ examples, type `make'.

To run the example, simply type in the program name:
e.g. `02.3.Trackball' 


WARNING
-------
Compiling and linking all of these programs will take up a large amount
of disk space.  Use the default make rules with caution.  The executable
files may also be stripped to reduce their size.
