Open Inventor - Examples from The Inventor Toolmaker

Chapter 8 - "Creating Draggers and Manipulators"


This directory contains source code that illustrates how to create
new Inventor dragger and manipulator nodes. 
The examples show how to create a simple dragger and a compound dragger.
It also shows how to make manipulators that employ each of these two
draggers.  The manipulators are SoTransformManips; derived from SoTransform,
they employ the draggers to make transforms which the user can edit 
interactively.
Finally, we show how to make a new flavor of manipulator, one that is derived
from SoCoordinate3. This new manip employs an SoDragPointDragger to edit
the points in 3-space.

See The Inventor Mentor for an introduction to draggers and manipulators.
