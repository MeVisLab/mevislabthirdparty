Chapter 3 - "Creating a Field"


*** THIS IS FOR EXPERTS ONLY! ***

This directory contains fragments of source code that 
illustrate how to create new fields.  No executable
program is created here.

Fields are the lightweight datatypes that all Inventor 
nodes (3D objects) are made of.  Each field class defines
a specific type of data.  For example, the existing 
field classes include:

	short
	int
	enum
	float
	Vector 3D
	Rotation

Note that fields come in two varieties:

	single-valued
	multiple-valued (arrays)

See the The Inventor Mentor, chapter 3 for an introduction to fields.
