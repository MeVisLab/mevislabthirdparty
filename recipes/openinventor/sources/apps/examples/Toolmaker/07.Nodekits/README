Open Inventor - Examples from the Inventor Toolmaker

Chapter 6 - "Creating a Node Kit"


This directory contains source code that illustrates how to create
a new node kit object.  Node Kits are macro nodes that group
a bunch of Inventor nodes into a fixed structure.

***NOTE*****
You must first compile the programs in the ../02.Nodes directory
before compiling here. This program depends on the pyramid 
class defined there. 
***NOTE*****

See The Inventor Mentor, chapter 14 for an introduction to node kits.
