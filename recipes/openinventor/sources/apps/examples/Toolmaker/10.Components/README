Open Inventor - Examples from the Inventor Toolmaker

Chapter 10 - "Creating Viewers and Components"


This directory contains source code that illustrates how to create
new Xt components and viewers.  

Components are C++ classes which can be used with Xt widgets
to build an interface. Viewer components provide interaction
and user interface for viewing and exploring Inventor data.

See the Inventor Mentor, chapter 16 for an introduction to 
viewers and components.
