//    This sample program reads in an inventor data file, and

//  Usage:
//      simpleViewer some_model
//

#include <Inventor/SoDB.h>      // for file reading
#include <Inventor/SoInput.h>   // for file reading
#include <Inventor/Xt/SoXt.h>   // For SoXtAppInitialize()
#include "simpleViewer.h"


int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

        printf("Usage: %s file.iv\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Initialize Inventor and Xt
    Widget myWindow = SoXt::init(argv[0]);
    
    // Read file in
    SoInput in;
