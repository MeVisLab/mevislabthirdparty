// Reads a binary-style variable from a buffer in another file
// and displays the result in a viewer.

//
// The file 'foo.h' contains a single variable called foo.
// This variable has been written out using the program
// ivToIncludeFile.
//
// For example, issuing the command:
// ivToIncludeFile foo < myFile.iv
//
// Will read in the file myFile.iv and write out a file called
// foo.h
// Inside foo.h will be the following:
// const char foo[] = { blah blah blah };
//
// Where 'blah blah blah' is a hex representation of the binary version of 
// the contents of myFile.iv
//
#include "foo.h"
