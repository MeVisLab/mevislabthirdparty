This directory contains source code for two programs.

The first is 'ivToIncludeFile'
It is used for converting Inventor files into source code
that you can compile into a program.  This is useful if you want to model
an object, then use it as an object in your program.  (This has two 
advantages over reading from a file at runtime. First, there are no extra
files to read in that might potentially get lost.  Second, reading from a 
compiled in binary buffer is faster than reading from an external file).

Given the command line:

ivToIncludeFile foo <  myFile.iv > foo.h

the program will read in myFile.iv (binary or ascii) and write out the file
foo.h, with the following syntax:

const char foo[] = { blah blah blah };

where 'blah blah blah' is a hex version of the contents of myFile.iv, 
translated into binary.



The second program is 'testResults'
This program assumes you have used ivToIncludeFile to create a file
foo.h, containing a variable foo.
It reads the contents of foo under a Separator node and displays it
within an examinerViewer.
