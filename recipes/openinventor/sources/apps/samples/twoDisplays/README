This sample demonstrates how to show Inventor components
on different X displays. The program creates and shows an
examiner viewer on the display on which the program is run.
When launched with a command line argument which is the name
of an X display, the program also creates and shows another
viewer on the named display.

For instance, if there is another display named "fred:0",
this program would be run:  'example fred:0'
