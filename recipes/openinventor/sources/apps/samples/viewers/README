		README for Inventor "viewers" sample
		------------------------------------

Run with no arguments to get the usage message.

This directory provides the source code to the Inventor component viewer
SoXtExaminerViewer, as well as the base classes SoXtFullViewer and
SoXtViewer. The class name were changed from SoXt* to My* to prevent
collision with the Inventor classes.

MyPixmapButton is also provided as a utility class to easily create motif
pixmap buttons that can be added to viewers. You can use
/usr/bin/X11/bitmap to create the actual icon.

NOTE: 
-----

The source code of the Examiner Viewer and its base classes are only
provided to help users understand how a viewer can be created and or
modified through subclassing. You should not modify this code and use it
since this code could change in the future. This would make it hard for
you to get new features or bug fixes.
