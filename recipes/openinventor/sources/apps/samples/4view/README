Run with no arguments to get the usage message.

This program reads in a scene graph from the file named on the command
line and displays four views of it, using different viewer components
glued together in a Motif form widget. Three of the viewers are plane
viewers, showing top, front, and right side orthographic views, and
the other is an examiner viewer showing an arbitrary perspective view.
The window configuration is like this:

		Top		Right
		View		View

		Front		Perspective
		View		View
