This sample builds and views a working 3d clock.
The geometry description for the clock is specified
in a file, and is passed into ivclock as a command
line argument. The ivclock program uses the examiner
viewer so you can zoom in or otherwise move the camera
around the clock geometry.

There is one geometry file in this directory which
builds a very simple clock - just the hands and numbers.
Feel free to customize this data, or create your own
from scratch!

Customizing your own clock
--------------------------
The ivclock program searches the input file for named separators 
which specify the hour, minute, and second hand geometry.
For example, DEF MinuteHand Separator { ... }. Make sure to name
the separators that define the clock hand geometry in the 
file (HourHand, MinuteHand, and SecondHand). If you leave out 
the second hand name, then ivclock will run with just the hour 
and minute hands. (This means it only updates once every minute, 
rather than once every second).

If you don't specify a custom file on the command line, ivclock
will use the default clock geometry file clockData.iv.

The ivclock program will rotate the hour, minute, and
second hands about the z axis to display the current time.
If you want more moving parts than this in your custom clock,
you'll have to edit the ivclock.c++ source file.
