		README for Inventor "vortex" sample
		-----------------------------------

Run with no arguments to get the usage message.

This program reads in a scene graph from the file named on the command
line and then uses the primitive generation feature of the
SoCallbackAction to produce an SoFaceSet consisting of triangles that
represent the shapes in the original graph. It then displays the face
set with a nice gold material in an examiner viewer.

Using an SoTimerSensor, the triangles in the face set are exploded
away from the center and rotated around, creating a vortex effect,
which then reverses. The relative speeds of the translation and
rotation can be controlled with command-line switches.

This sample is intended solely to show how to use primitive
generation.
