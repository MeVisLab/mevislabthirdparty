This directory contains the Open Inventor sample programs.
These programs are distributed in source format to the Inventor
customers.  Many of these programs are simple and sloppy,
but show some interesting aspect of Inventor.

Each subdirectory contains the source code and include files needed to
make the program.  Note that you need superuser permissions to build or 
modify the installed sample programs.  Alternatively, you can copy the 
programs that interest you into your local directory.


The sample programs include:

4view 	    - Displays four views of a scene graph - together in one
	      Motif widget.
ViewKit     - Shows how Inventor and ViewKit can be used together
clock       - simple Inventor clock program
common 	    - Contains some common functions used by other samples
ivToInclude - Tools for turning Inventor scene files into buffer variables
              in include files that can be compiled into a program.
ivNodeKitStructure -
	      Prints out information about all parts (public and private) 
	      in the catalog of a nodekit class.
linkages    - Interactive linkage program which defines new nodekit
	      classes (e.g., Link and Crank) that contain draggers as parts.
lod 	    - Demonstrates how to use the level-of-detail node.
manip 	    - Shows how all of the manipulators work
motif 	    - Demonstrates how to build Motif pulldown menus
spaceball   - Demonstrates how to integrate a spaceball into Inventor
twoDisplays - Demonstrates how to show Inventor components on different X 
	      displays.
viewers     - Source code of the SoXtExaminerViewer and parent classes
vortex      - explodes any object - demonstrates the SoCallbackAction's 
	      "get primitives" feature
widgets     - contains the code for several Xt components, as well
	      as code for drag-and-drop and file conversion using FTR rules.
