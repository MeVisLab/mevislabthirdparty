 |   Description:
 |      This class describes a base class for constructing pieces used in
 |      the drop demo program.  Pieces are composed of blocks arranged
 |      in some order which defines the particular piece.  The pieces are
 |      stored as indices into a three dimensional array (the playing field)
 |      for each block that is part of the piece.  Operations on the piece
 |      move it to different locations and orientations on the playing field
 |      by modifying the indices into the playing field.
