This directory contains source code for the Open Inventor demo program
'textomatic' (a very simple 3D text editor).

When you run textomatic, you will first see only flat text.  
To give the text depth, select "Edit Parts" and turn on 
the "Sides" and "Back" parts.

Select "About..." to bring up a showcase document with more information
on textomatic.  The showcase document is installed with the 
'inventor_eoe.demo.progs' subsystem.
