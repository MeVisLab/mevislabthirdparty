The SceneViewer program is a 3d editor/demonstration program 
which exercises many of the features of Inventor.  
The program lets the user read in various Inventor data files 
and arrange them to form a scene.  The main viewer for the SceneViewer 
is initially the SoXtExaminerViewer, although other viewers may
be used by selecting from the menu bar.  The menu bar allows many different
editors and manipulators to be used in modifying the scene.

The SceneViewer can save Environment files which contain camera,
lighting, and environment data SEPARATE from the scene.
