//
// Inventor base class for scene graphs that can be used as
// Backgrounds (static and animated).
//
// Backgrounds should typically be the first child of a LayerGroup.
// They have their own cameras, sensors, etc.  Note that when being
// used with a Viewer, the program should do the following:
//
// Create a LayerGroup.
// Create the Background, and add it as the first child of the
// LayerGroup.
// Create the 'main' scene graph.
// Add a camera to the 'main' scene graph if it doesn't have one.
// Create the Viewer.
// Pass the LayerGroup to the setSceneGraph method of the viewer
// Pass the camera created or found to the setCamera method of the
// viewer (or the viewer will incorrectly use the Background's
// camera).
