This directory contains the maze program.  The program is a marble
maze game, where the user must tilt the maze, maneuvering the marble.
The object is to traverse the maze to the end without falling in any of
the holes.

The game uses the examiner viewer with viewing mode turned off.  The left
mouse button controls the tilt of the maze.    

The game is restarted by pressing the R key.  There are three levels
of difficulty, level 1 being the easiet.  The levels are switched by
pressing the 1, 2, or 3 keys.


Custom Maze files:
-----------------
Custom mazes can be creating a file as described below,
and running maze with the maze file argument:

	maze myMaze


The top array specifies the location of horizontal walls,
the middle array specifies the location of vertical walls, 
and the bottom array specifies locations of holes.

A 1 means the wall or hole is present, and a 0 means not present.
A 2 in the holes array specifies the starting position and a 3 specifies
the finishing position.
