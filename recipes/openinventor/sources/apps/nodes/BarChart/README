This directory contains code for the BarChart node, a Shape node that
displays a set of data as a set of bars.

A sample data file (BarChart.iv) is provided.  Once you have compiled
the BarChart.so DSO by typing 'make' in this directory, run:

ivview BarChart.iv

... to see an example use of the BarChart node.  You'll have to read
the source (in BarChart.c++ and BarChart.h) for more information!
