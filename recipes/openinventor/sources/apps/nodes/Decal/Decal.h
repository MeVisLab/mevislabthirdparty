//  Class: Decal
//
//  Decal node used to correctly render coplanar polygons
//
//  This class is derived from SoSeparator with a different rendering
//  behavior.  The first child is the base node and the other children
//  are layers to be drawn above the base (in the order in which they
//  are defined).  Some or all of the layers can be coplanar with the 
//  base.  The layer polygons must lie within the base polygon otherwise
//  the results are incorrect
//  
//  All non-rendering actions are inherited as is from SoSeparator.
