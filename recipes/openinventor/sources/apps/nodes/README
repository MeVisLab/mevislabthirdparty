This directory contains the source code for some
unsupported Open Inventor nodes:

BarChart   - displays data as a bar chart
Decal      - a group that allows co-planar geometries to be drawn
             without z-buffer ugliness
GeneralizedCylinder - a shape node that is a cross-section swept out
                      along an arbitrary spine

Each subdirectory contains the source code and include files needed to
make a dynamic shared object (DSO) for the node.  If you put the
DSO's into /usr/local/lib/InventorDSO/ all Inventor programs will be
able to read files containing the new nodes.

Note that you need superuser permissions to build or modify the installed
demo programs.  Alternatively, you can copy the programs that interest you
into your local directory.
