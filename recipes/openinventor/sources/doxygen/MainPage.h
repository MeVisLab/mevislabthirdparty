\section Introduction

Open Inventor is an object-oriented 3D toolkit originally developed by Silicon Graphics (SGI) offering a comprehensive solution to interactive graphics programming problems. 

The MeVisLab implementation of Open Inventor is based on the original SGI source code that was released to the public in 2000. It is suited for use with MeVisLab but can also be used independently. You are welcome to use our MacOS X & MS Windows port for your own purposes.

For details on the changes that have been applied to Open Inventor, have a look at the \ref releasenotes.
