The Inventor Files in this directory contain the default scene graphs
used for the geometry of all Inventor draggers.

Each dragger has some parts that are each set from a "resource name."
The man pages and header files detail the resource name used for each
part of each dragger.

To override the defaults, copy one or more of these files to a working
directory and set the environment variable SO_DRAGGER_DIR to be the path
to that directory.  Then, edit the scene graphs of the resources you want
to change. For more information, see "The Inventor Mentor"

When you start up an Inventor program, it will let any resources defined
here take precedence over the compiled-in defaults.  Note that a dragger
class will only read resources from the file corresponding to the class name.
(e.g., SoTranslate1Dragger looks in translate1Dragger.iv)
