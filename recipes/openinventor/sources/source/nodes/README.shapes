Some source files for shapes are preprocessed by running them through
"ppp". This allows similar rendering and primitive generation methods
to be created from the same template. The format accepted by the
preprocessor is documented in the ppp.cpp source file. Note that only
the original .pp files should be edited, since the .cpp files are
recreated whenever the .pp files change.

Because some shapes have several GL rendering methods, we use an
abbreviated naming scheme for these methods. The name indicates the
material binding ("M"), normal binding ("N"), and texture coordinate
case ("T") that the corresponding method handles. The names are:

	For material bindings:
	For material and normal bindings:
		none = none (valid for normals only)
		oall = OVERALL
		part = PER_PART
		face = PER_FACE
		find = PER_FACE_INDEXED
		vert = PER_VERTEX
		vind = PER_VERTEX_INDEXED

	For texture coordinate case:
		none = none (no texture present or automatically generated)
		shap = shape uses texture coordinates in state or
			creates its own coordinates
		func = generated using a texture coordinate function

For example, the "GLRenderMoallNvertTshap" method uses overall
materials, per-vertex normals, and the shape's texture coordinates. If
a particular binding or case is not relevant, it can be left out. For
example, "GLRenderNvertTnone" is a method on SoSphere, since spheres
have only one material case: overall.
