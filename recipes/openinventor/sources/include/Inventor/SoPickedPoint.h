\class SoPickedPoint
\ingroup General
An SoPickedPoint represents a point on the surface of an object
that was picked by applying an SoRayPickAction to a scene. It
contains a path to the picked shape, the point of intersection, the
surface normal and texture coordinates at that point, and other
information.


Each node in the picked path may have a corresponding instance of a detail
subclass. These detail instances are stored in the SoPickedPoint.
