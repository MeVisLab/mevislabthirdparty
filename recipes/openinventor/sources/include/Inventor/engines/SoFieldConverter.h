////  \class SoFieldConverter
///
///  Abstract base class for all field converter engines. A field
///  converter engine is used to convert the value of a field of one
///  type to another. These engines are registered with the global
///  database so connections between fields of different types can be
///  made by automatically inserting a converter instance.
///  A single class of converter engine may be registered for several
///  different conversions.
///  Field converters are never written to file
///  (SoField::writeConnection takes care of that).
