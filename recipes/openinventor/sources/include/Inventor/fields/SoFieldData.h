///
////  \class SoFieldData
///
///  The SoFieldData class holds data about fields of an object: the
///  number of fields the object has, the names of the fields, and a
///  pointer to a prototype instance of the field. (Typically, this
///  prototype field is contained within a prototype instance of the
///  node or engine.)
///
///  All objects of a given class share the same field data. Therefore,
///  to get information about a particular field in a particular object
///  instance, it is necessary to pass that instance to the appropriate
///  method.
