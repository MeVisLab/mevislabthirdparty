///  Class SoCache:
///
///  This is the base class for all types of caches. Each cache
///  maintains the following information:
///
///      A reference count, used to allow sharing of cache instances.
///      ref() and unref() methods increment and decrement the count.
///
///      An elements-used list. This is a list of elements used in the
///      cache that are set outside it. A cache is invalidated if any
///      of these elements has changed since the cache was created.
///      There is also an elements-flag array so we can quickly tell if
///      an element type has already been added to the elements-used
///      list.
