 |
 |   Description:
 |      This file defines the SoGLCacheList class, which can be used
 |      is used by nodes like Separator to maintain a list of render
 |      caches that might be used.  It also implements an auto caching
 |      scheme that tries to be smart about only building caches when
 |      things are not changing.
 |
 |   Typical use:
 |      In a node's GLRender method:
 |         if (cacheList->call(state)) return;
 |         cacheList->open(state, TRUE);
 |         ... do normal children stuff...
 |         cacheList->close();
 |
 |     In a node's notify method:
 |         cacheList->invalidateAll();
