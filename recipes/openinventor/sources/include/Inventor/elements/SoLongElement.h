 |   Description:
 |      This file defines the abstract SoEXTENDER SoLongElement class.
 |      This is a base class used to make the library smaller by
 |      sharing code.

 |      SoLongElement

Error: SoLongElement invalid with -DIV_STRICT, see <Inventor/elements/SoLongElement.h>
------
Inventor now provides SoInt32Element types in place of SoLongElement types to 
simplify porting to other architectures and operating systems.  

You should use SoInt32Element in place of SoLongElement and also change longs 
in your code to the appropriate sized typedef from <inttypes.h>.   The perl 
script  /usr/sbin/longToInt32  can assist you making this transition.  Note 
that not all longs should be changed as some are determined by other system 
include files.
