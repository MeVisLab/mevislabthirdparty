///
///  \class SoGLTextureEnabledElement
///  \ingroup Elements
///
///  Element that enables/disables textures.  This is implemented as a
///  separate element from the TextureImageElement so the texture image
///  can be changed without blowing caches containing shapes-- shapes
///  need to know if texturing is going on or not so they can decide to
///  send down texture coordinates or not.
///
///  This is set by the GLTextureImageElement and the
///  GLTextureImageElement; the interaction between the three is a
///  little complicated.  Each of the other two elements always sets up
///  the GL texture state appropriately; however, texturing is only
///  enabled if both elements agree that it should be enabled (they
///  check each other's value before calling set).
///
///  This element cannot be overridden, but, since the elements that
///  set it check each other's value, overriding those elements has
///  the same effect.
