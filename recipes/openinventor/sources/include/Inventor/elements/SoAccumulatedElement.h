///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///
///  \class SoAccumulatedElement
///  \ingroup Elements
///
///  This is the abstract base class for each state element whose value
///  may be accumulated when it is set. (This is rare.) Examples are
///  transformations and profiles.
///
///  Subclasses may need to override the push() method to copy values
///  from the next instance in the stack (using getNextInStack() ),
///  if the new one has to accumulate values on top of the old ones.
///
///  This class defines the matches() method to compare lists of
///  node-id's. The node-id's represent the states of all nodes that
///  changed the value of the element. SoAccumulatedElement provides
///  methods that maintain lists of node-id's of all nodes that affect
///  an instance. Subclasses must call these methods to make sure the
///  id's are up to date, if they plan to use the standard matches()
///  method. Otherwise, they can define matches() differently, if they
///  wish.
