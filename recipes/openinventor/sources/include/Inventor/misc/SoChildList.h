///
////  \class SoChildList
///
///  This class maintains a list of child nodes for any node. It allows
///  children to be added, removed, replaced, and accessed. The SoGroup
///  class has an instance of this class and provides public methods
///  for dealing with children. Other classes can also have an instance
///  of this class and may choose to publicize whatever methods they
///  wish for dealing with them. The SoNode::getChildren() method
///  returns the child list for any node class.
///
///  SoChildList automatically maintains the auditor list for parent
///  nodes. That is, when a child is added to the list, the parent node
///  is automatically added as a parent auditor of the child. To make
///  this possible, the parent node must be passed in to the
///  constructors of the SoChildList class.
