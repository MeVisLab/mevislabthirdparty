///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
///
////  \class SoCompactPathList
///
///  This class represents a list of paths (like an SoPathList) in a
///  more compact form. Since many paths in a path list may share
///  common sub-paths from common head nodes, this class stores them
///  with less redundancy.
///
///  The SoCompactPathList constructor is passed an SoPathList. It is
///  assumed that the SoPathList is not empty and that all paths in the
///  SoPathList have a common head node; an error will occur otherwise.
///  It is also assumed that no two paths are identical, and that if
///  one path goes through node X, then no other path will end at node
///  X.
///
///  While an SoPathList provides random access to any node in any
///  path, an SoCompactPathList provides only sequential access. That
///  is, you can only access the paths in the list in order. Each
///  instance maintains the notion of the "current node" - the node
///  that traversal has last reached - to support this access.
///
