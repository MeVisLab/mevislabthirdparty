///
////  \class SoNotRec
///
///  Records one step in the path taken by notification. Instances of
///  this class are typically allocated on the stack as automatic
///  variables.
///
///  There is an SoBase pointer in the record that points to the base
///  (node, path, or engine) from which the notification is being
///  propagated. The contents of this pointer depend on the type of
///  the notification. The type also indicates the nature of the
///  notification. These are the possible types:
///
///      CONTAINER:  A field has changed value and is notifying its
///                  container node or engine. The base is the container.
///
///      PARENT:     A child of a group has changed and is notifying
///                  its parent. The base is the child.
///
///      SENSOR:     A node or path is notifying a sensor of a change.
///                  The base is the thing to which the sensor is attached.
///
///      FIELD:      A field in a node or engine is notifying the
///                  field to which it is connected. The base is the
///                  container of the source field.
///
///      ENGINE:     An engine is notifying a field to which it is
///                  connected. The base is the engine.
