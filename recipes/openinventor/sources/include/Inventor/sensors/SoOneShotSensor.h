\class SoOneShotSensor
\ingroup Sensors
A one-shot sensor is triggered once after it is scheduled, when the
delay queue is processed.  Like all delay queue sensors, one-shot
sensors with a non-zero priority are just added to the delay queue
when scheduled; if they are scheduled again before the delay queue is
processed nothing happens, and they are guaranteed to be called only
once when the delay queue is processed.  For example, a one-shot
sensor whose callback function redraws the scene might be scheduled
whenever the scene graph changes and whenever a window-system event
reporting that the window changed size occurs.  By using a one-shot,
the scene will only be redrawn once even if a window-changed-size
event occurs just after the scene graph is modified (or if several
window-changed-size events occur in a row).


Calling schedule() in the callback function is a useful way of
getting something to happen repeatedly as often as possible, while
still handling events and timeouts.


A priority 0 one-shot sensor isn't very useful, since scheduling it is
exactly the same as directly calling its callback function.
