 |   Description:
 |      This file contains the definition of the SbCylinderSectionProjector
 |      class. This projector projects the mouse position onto the
 |      section of a cylinder that has been sliced by a plane.
 |
 |      The tolerance slice can be specified as a fraction of the radius
 |      of the cylinder. The projection point will not extend beyond the
 |      sliced portion of the cylinder.

\class SbCylinderSectionProjector
\ingroup Projectors
SbCylinderSectionProjector 
projects a window space point (usually based on the mouse location)
onto the section of a cylinder that has been sliced by a plane.
Two projected points can produce a rotation
along the cylinder's axis.
The tolerance slice can be specified as a fraction of the radius
of the cylinder. The projection point will not extend beyond the
sliced portion of the cylinder.


Incremental changes (delta rotation) can be computed during
interactive sessions. Cylinder projectors are typically used to write
interactive 3D manipulators and viewers.
