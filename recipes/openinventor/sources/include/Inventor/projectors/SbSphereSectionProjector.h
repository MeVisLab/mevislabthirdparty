 |   Description:
 |      This file contains the definition of the SbSphereSectionProjector
 |      class. This projector projects the mouse position onto the 
 |      section of a sphere that has been sliced by a plane.
 |
 |      The tolerance slice can be specified as a fraction of the radius
 |      of the sphere. The projection point will not extend beyond
 |      the sliced portion of the sphere.
 |
 |      This projector is good for trackballs that only do
 |      pure roll when the mouse is off the sliced portion of
 |      the sphere.

\class SbSphereSectionProjector
\ingroup Projectors
SbSphereSectionProjector 
projects a window space point (usually based on the mouse location)
onto the section of a sphere that has been sliced by a plane.
Two projected points can produce a rotation
about the sphere's center.
The tolerance slice can be specified as a fraction of the radius
of the sphere. The projection point will not extend beyond the
sliced portion of the sphere.


Incremental changes (delta rotation) can be computed during
interactive sessions. Sphere projectors are typically used to write
interactive 3D manipulators and viewers.
